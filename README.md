# RailWatch
=========

A real-time safety platform that enables citizens to instantly report railroad hazards and alert railroad operations centers.

**The Problem**
---------------

Since moving to Washington State, I've been surrounded by extensive railroad activity - freight trains moving through communities daily. When I asked my wife (who worked at BNSF Railway) what someone should do if they saw a hazard on the tracks, her answer surprised me.

While passenger rail systems have visible security infrastructure, freight rail safety reporting primarily relies on the **FRA Emergency Notification System (ENS)** - signs posted at every public railroad crossing with emergency contact information.

**Current System - ENS Signs at Railroad Crossings:**

-   Posted at every public railroad crossing with emergency phone numbers
-   Requires finding the nearest crossing with a sign
-   Involves calling and waiting on hold (often 5-10 minutes)
-   Depends on verbal location descriptions
-   **Only works at designated crossings** - hazards between crossings require driving to find the nearest sign

I started researching this system and realized while ENS signs are effective for their purpose, there was an opportunity to complement them with modern technology.

**This can take 10-15 minutes when every second counts.**

**The Solution**
----------------

RailWatch modernizes railroad safety reporting with instant digital communication.

### **For Citizens:**

-   Report hazards from anywhere along the rail network (not just crossings)
-   Capture photo evidence with your phone camera
-   GPS automatically identifies the railroad and precise location
-   Submit in 30 seconds with instant confirmation
-   Track status updates in real-time

### **For Railroad Operations:**

-   Receive alerts instantly with photos and exact GPS coordinates
-   See hazards on interactive map dashboard
-   Acknowledge receipt immediately (citizen gets notified)
-   Update status as crews respond and resolve issues
-   Better information quality leads to faster, safer responses

### **Key Innovation:**

Real-time WebSocket communication creates a complete feedback loop - reports appear on railroad dashboards instantly, and citizens see immediate confirmation that their report was received and is being addressed.

**How It Works**
----------------

```
1\. Citizen sees hazard anywhere along rail network
2. Opens RailWatch → GPS detects "You're near BNSF track, Mile 247.3"
3. Takes photo and selects hazard type
4. Submits report in 30 seconds
5. Alert BN-67890 instantly appears on BNSF operations dashboard with photo
6. BNSF dispatcher clicks "Acknowledge"
7. Citizen receives real-time notification: "BNSF acknowledged your report at 2:47 PM"
8. Status updates as issue is resolved

```

**Why This Matters**
--------------------

**ENS signs work, but have limitations:**

-   Only at designated crossings (hazards between crossings require finding the nearest sign)
-   Phone-based reporting with hold times
-   No visual evidence
-   No confirmation that report was received
-   Limited to areas where signs are posted

**RailWatch complements and enhances the existing system:**

-   Works anywhere along 140,000+ miles of US rail network
-   Instant digital reporting (no hold times)
-   GPS-accurate location data (no verbal description confusion)
-   Photo evidence for faster assessment and response
-   Complete feedback loop with status tracking

**Technical Architecture**
--------------------------

Built with enterprise railroad integration in mind:

-   **Real-time communication** via WebSocket for instant alerts
-   **Geospatial intelligence** for railroad identification and routing
-   **Mobile-first design** optimized for field reporting
-   **Scalable architecture** ready for national railroad network
-   **API-ready** for integration with railroad dispatch systems

**Current Features**
--------------------

-   ✅ Hazard reporting with photo upload and GPS capture
-   ✅ Automatic railroad identification (BNSF, UP, CSX, etc.)
-   ✅ Real-time alert dispatch to railroad operations dashboards
-   ✅ Interactive map showing active hazards by location
-   ✅ Two-way communication (citizens get acknowledgment notifications)
-   ✅ Status tracking through complete lifecycle
-   ✅ Mock railroad integration demonstrating API patterns

**Production Roadmap**
----------------------

**Phase 1 (Current):** Core safety reporting with simulated railroad integrations\
**Phase 2:** Community verification system for accuracy and reduced false alarms\
**Phase 3:** ML-powered hazard classification and priority assessment\
**Phase 4:** Integration with actual railroad dispatch systems and APIs\
**Phase 5:** Native mobile apps (iOS/Android) and expanded coverage

**Integration Potential**
-------------------------

The platform is architected for seamless integration with railroad operations systems:

-   RESTful APIs for bidirectional communication
-   Webhook support for status updates
-   Flexible authentication for railroad employee access
-   Configurable alert routing and escalation workflows
-   Compatible with existing railroad tech infrastructure

**Safety Note**
---------------

RailWatch is designed to supplement existing emergency procedures. For immediate life-threatening situations, always call 911 first. RailWatch excels at quickly reporting important hazards that need attention but aren't immediate emergencies - the majority of track safety issues.

**Impact Potential**
--------------------

Railroads move 40% of America's freight. Track hazards can cause:

-   Train derailments with catastrophic consequences
-   Delays to critical cargo (medical supplies, food, fuel)
-   Millions in rerouting and operational costs
-   Risk to crew and public safety

**Faster hazard reporting means faster response times, which means safer railroads for everyone.**

Every minute saved in reporting could prevent an incident. Every hazard photo helps dispatchers make better decisions. Every real-time alert could save lives.

**Built to make America's railroad network safer through better technology.**
